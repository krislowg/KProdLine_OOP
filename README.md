# ProductLineOOP
Software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. <br />
I made this project independently for my Object Oriented Programming class from September-December 2019.<br />
It is a class project that applies the majority of the OOP concepts. This assignment allowed me to apply the concepts of interface, enumerations, recursion, and many more.
The Production Line project integrates GUI with database. For this program we used Java, JavaFX, and SQL H2 database.
It was a fun project to develop, it was my first time working with databases.

## Diagrams
See ProductDiagram.pdf and ProductRecordDiagram.pdf   

## Getting Started
1.	Have IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate version installed 
2.	Click on VCS then click on Check out from version control then Git
3.	Copy the following URL in the URL entry: https://github.com/krislowg/KProdLine_OOP
4.  In order to run the software, go to the main.java file and click on Run.
5.	NOTE: The database tables are not accessible while the program is running. As long as it is running, if the user clicks on H2 KPL the tables will not be displayed. The tables, PRODUCT and PRODUCTIONRECORD will be accessible after stopping the run and refreshing the project.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized**
Inheritance: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).<br />
Controller: a compiled class that implements the "code behind" the object hierarchy defined by the document.<br />
Event handler: the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen, if an event occurs. <br />
Exception handling:is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.<br />
Try/Catch: The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.<br />
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. <br />
Execute a query: using an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to insert records into a table.<br />
DataBase initialize method:this method is typically used when it is necessary to ensure that the database has been created and seeded before starting some operation<br />

Beta
PreparedStatement:  is a special kind of Java JDBC Statement object with some useful additional features.<br />
Observable list: is a list that allows listeners to track changes when they occur.<br />
Enumerations: a list of named constant.<br />
Interface: is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies<br />

Final
Regex: is a character or a sequence of characters that represent a String or Multiple Strings. <br />
Recursion: is when a method makes a call to itself. <br />
Robustness: s a style of programming that prevents abnormal termination or unexpected actions<br />
