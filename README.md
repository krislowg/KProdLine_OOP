## History

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized**
Inheritance: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
Controller: a compiled class that implements the "code behind" the object hierarchy defined by the document.
Event handler: the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen, if an event occurs. 
Exception handling:is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.
Try/Catch: The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. 
Execute a query: using an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to insert records into a table.
DataBase initialize method:this method is typically used when it is necessary to ensure that the database has been created and seeded before starting some operation

Beta
PreparedStatement:  is a special kind of Java JDBC Statement object with some useful additional features.
Observable list: is a list that allows listeners to track changes when they occur.
Enumerations: a list of named constant.
Interface: is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies
